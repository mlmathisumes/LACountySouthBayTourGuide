# LA County SouthBay Tour Guide App

* Navigating between lists in Fragments using a ViewPager and TabLayout
* Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information
* Creating a custom class 
* Properly handling images 
* Utilizing the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/map) to display locations
